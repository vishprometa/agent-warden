# Session: 2025-02-25

## What Was Done

### Cleanup: Removed all version label references from code
Found and fixed 11 remaining "v2" references in code comments and descriptions:
- `cmd/agentwarden/main.go` — comment "v2 — SDK/webhook event receiver"
- `internal/config/loader_test.go` — comment "v2 config fields"
- `internal/server/grpc.go` — package doc "AgentWarden v2"
- `sdks/python/agentwarden/__init__.py` — docstring "SDK v2"
- `sdks/python/agentwarden/integrations/__init__.py` — docstring "AgentWarden v2"
- `sdks/python/agentwarden/integrations/crewai.py` — docstring "AgentWarden v2"
- `sdks/python/agentwarden/integrations/langchain.py` — 3 references (docstring + "v1 vs v2" comparison)
- `sdks/python/agentwarden/integrations/openai_agents.py` — docstring "AgentWarden v2"
- `sdks/typescript/package.json` — description "AgentWarden v2"

Committed and pushed: `8e455a4`

### Created `.claude-journal/` tracking system
- `tracker.csv` — daily task log (date, category, task, status, notes)
- `future-todos.md` — prioritized backlog (5 tiers + ideas)
- `learnings.md` — architecture decisions, tradeoffs, open questions
- `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — per-session detailed logs (this file)

### Created PM.md — Product Management Guide
- **Push review rules**: When to bump version (major/minor/patch) and when NOT to
- **Push quality checklist**: Build, test, no secrets, no debug comments
- **Product research**: Full competitive positioning against 30+ products across 5 categories
- Covers: LLM Proxies, Guardrails, Observability, Agent Frameworks, Control Planes
- **6 key differentiators**: sidecar (not proxy), full session tracking, self-evolution, MD-based config, playbook detection, CEL + LLM judge
- **Positioning statement**, target personas, risks & gaps, competitive moats
- Market size data ($7.84B → $52.62B by 2030)

### Created competitive-analysis.md
- Deep dive on 30+ competitors with per-product tables
- Feature comparison matrix and architecture comparison
- "Why us" arguments ranked by strength
- Risk analysis with mitigations
- Market context and funding landscape

## Files Created
- `.claude-journal/PM.md`
- `.claude-journal/competitive-analysis.md`
- `.claude-journal/sessions/2025-02-24.md`
- `.claude-journal/sessions/2025-02-25.md`
- `.claude-journal/README.md`
- `.claude-journal/tracker.csv`
- `.claude-journal/future-todos.md`
- `.claude-journal/learnings.md`

## Blockers / Waiting On User
Need from user to proceed with next phase:
1. **GitHub PAT** — for creating repos, managing Actions, fixing CI
2. **Vercel token** — for deploying docs site
3. **LLM API key** — for AI-judge policies, evolution engine, testing real agents
4. **Test agent choice** — what kind of agent to build for E2E validation
5. **Domain** (optional) — for docs site

## Next Session Should
- Once LLM key is provided: build a real agent, wire through AgentWarden, test E2E
- Set up GitHub Actions CI (Go build + test)
- Deploy docs to Vercel
- Start validating: does AgentWarden actually help, or is it useless?
